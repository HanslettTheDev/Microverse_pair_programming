          <li><b>2000:</b> Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980 in Porto Alegre)</li>
          <li><b>2001:</b> As a Brazilian footballer who plays for Italian Serie A club 
            Milan and the Brazilian national team. 
            He is a free-kick specialist and has exceptional dribbling ability. 
            Ronaldinho, Portuguese for \"Little Ronaldo,\" is known in Brazil by the nickname \"GaÃºcho,\" 
            in order to distinguish him from Ronaldo, who was already called \"Ronaldinho\" in Brazil. 
            Ronaldo simply went by his first name upon his move to Europe, thereby allowing Ronaldinho to drop the \"GaÃºcho\" 
            and remain simply as Ronaldinho.</li>
          <li><b>2003:</b> Prior to his move to Milan, he played for Paris Saint-Germain and FC Barcelona, with whom he won his first Champions League in 2006 and 
            he won the Ballon d\'Or in 2005. He became a Spanish citizen in January 2007.[3]Ronaldinho is one of the best soccer players 
            I ever saw in my life. He does everything very nicely: freekicks, dribles, shoot, velocity, 
            stamina and the list goes on. Ronaldinho has a vision of the game that not many others players does</li>
          <li><b>2006: </b>
            His mother, Dona Miguelina de Assis, is a former salesperson who studied to become a nurse. His father, JoÃ£o Moreira, was a 
            shipyard worker and footballer for local club Esporte Clube Cruzeiro (not to be confused with Cruzeiro).[4] 
            He suffered a fatal heart attack in the family swimming pool when Ronaldinho was eight. After Ronaldinho\'s older brother, 
            Roberto, signed with GrÃªmio, the family moved to a home in the more affluent GuarujÃ¡ section of Porto Alegre, 
            which was a gift from GrÃªmio to convince Roberto to stay at the club
